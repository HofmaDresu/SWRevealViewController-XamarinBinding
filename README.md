SWRevealViewController-XamarinBinding
=====================================
A UIViewController subclass for revealing a rear (left and/or right) view controller behind a front controller, inspired by the Facebook app, done right!  
I have not made the project this is merely the a XamarinBinding for it. You can find the xcode project here: [SWRevealViewController](https://github.com/John-Lluch/SWRevealViewController)
